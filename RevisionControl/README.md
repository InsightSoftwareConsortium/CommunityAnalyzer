# Revision Control Statistics

This directory contains scripts and code used to analyze the vitality of a
project, based on the activity in its source code revision control system.

In this case, we focus on Git, given its current popularity among open source
communities.

The scripts and code are split into the three major categories:

* Data collection
* Data analysis
* Visualization and reporting

## Data Collection

The first category gathers information directly from the revision control
system.

## Data Analysis

The second category parses this information and computes several measures of
activity.

## Visualization and Reporting

The third category generates informative reports and visuals of the activity
metrics.
